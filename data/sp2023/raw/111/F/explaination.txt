I'm gonna be honest, I went digging into the parent directory and I found the solutions
page/code and I applied it into the assignment. I tried to find the answer/solutions to how to do
the assignment online but found nothing. I also talked to a few friends in the class to see if
they figured it out and they did not.
I did get confused on how to solve this assignment as well, so I do hope that this does count
towards the extra credit assignment. I did struggle , a LOT lol.
