Processing
==========

This is a modified version of [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE),
the “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download).

for the most part it is identical but some advanced plagerism tracking features have been added.
Oh, and we hooked up stdin and fixed a bug in color that the main team refuses to fix.

__Please help.__
The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).
Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save me a lot of time.
